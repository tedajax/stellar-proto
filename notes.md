Movement Comments By Michael:
=============
- [x] Wall jump should have a short hop up when pressing against wall that's on.
- [x] Need more time before sliding down wall.
- [ ] Movement feels a bit floaty perhaps?
- [X] Jump button forgiveness timing window too large.
- [ ] Stick to wall when first hit it?

Features needed nowish:
=========
- [ ] Flag
    - [ ] Flag exists and spawns at level spawn point, acts as player spawn point
    - [ ] Flag can be picked up, dropped, thrown
    - [ ] Flag can be reset to level spawn
- [ ] Spikes or some basic environmental trap
